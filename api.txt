As a developer I want recron to have a simple api.

Specifically I want something that looks like this.

import recron

jobs = recron.get_jobs()

for job in jobs:
    
    job.health > success percentage of last 5 executions 
    job.status > SUCCESS|FAILURE|RUNNING
    job.history > [job event, ... ]
    job.runs_at > [ contab line ]
    job.command > command to execute.
    job.name
        
        If a job is created in the crontab this will be command with spaces, and special characters
        replaced by underscore and dashes where appropriate.
        
        If the job has a name or is assigned a name it will be moved to crontab.ini where the name
        will identify it's section in the ini file.
        
Job history will be a list of job execution objects with the following attrs:
    
    time, when did the job run.
    duration, how long did it take, -1 if job is still running.
    status, did it succeed or fail. SUCCESS|FAILURE|RUNNING
    status_code, the proccess execution code. None if the job is running.
    output, returns an open read stream with the jobs stdout, and stderr caputred.
    
recron.connect("job_start|job_stop|job_fail|job_succeed", [name optional], callback)

    run a callback when a job stat chanes per the first argument.
    
    job_start - when any job starts, or when name is passed the named job starts.
    job_stop = when a job finishes, regardless of error code.
    job_fail - when a job stopped and failed
    job_succeed - when a job stopped and succeeded
